title: About these Notes
---
Hi, I'm Luke!

Welcome to my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), [hypertext notebook](https://scalingsynthesis.com/Q-What-is-a-hypertext-notebook/), [nonlinear manifesto](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/writing-in-hypertext), and [thinking environment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

This site uses bi-directional links to communicate and connect ideas in a public notebook. I [borrowed the idea](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), because I wanted to place to think and write in public.

The metaphor of a garden is fitting. Many of the notes here are undeveloped and untamed. My goal is to prune and tend them. Hopefully the harvest will come later.

### Exploring the Garden

Navigating a site like this will be unusual for people who are used to the linear, chronological structure of most blogs and websites. So let me briefly say something about that.

Internal links will open in side-by-side panels. That's obvious enough. The effect here is like exploring a new area without a map. All the hyperlink paths are free to travel on. Just click one that looks interesting and start exploring.

### A Theory of Knowledge

These notes are the raw materials with which I am assembling a working theory of knowledge. A layman's guide to knowledge work. A street-level epistemology.

This work is built on a few baseline assumptions:
- 1. [[Life is a serious enough context for taking and using notes.]]
- 2. [[We need tools for thought that are designed for generalists, not just specialists.]]
- 3. [[All discourse is multilayered, resisting reductionist approaches to interpretation.]]
- 4. [[Traditional analytic tools fail to prepare students for the complexity of human discourse.]]
